# Autoregressive Quantum Neural Networks (QNNs) with PennyLane

This repository explores the use of **Autoregressive Quantum Neural Networks (QNNs)**, combining quantum computing and autoregressive modeling to capture dependencies in quantum systems. The project leverages controlled rotation gates in quantum circuits and applies these QNNs within a Variational Monte Carlo framework to estimate the ground state energy of a Hamiltonian.

## Features
- **Quantum Circuit Construction**: Design autoregressive circuits with controlled rotation gates.
- **Variational Monte Carlo Framework**: Apply QNNs for energy minimization tasks.
- **Step-by-Step Tutorial**: Detailed instructions for reproducing the implementation.
